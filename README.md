CompareTCN
R functions to compare Total Copy Number (TCN) starting from copy number segment calls (such as FACETS cncf file).

Patient Analysis Function
This script provides a function to analyze copy number variation (CNV) data for specified patients, generate plots, and produce annotations. The script is organized as a group of functions, allowing straightforward reusability.

Usage
Function Name: generate_patient_analysis()
Parameters
cncf_path : Path to the CNV file in TSV format.
biomart_gr_path : Path to the biomart annotations in RDS format (GRanges).
patient_ids : Vector of patient IDs to process.
outDir : Directory to save the results.
oncokb_cnas_path : Path to OncoKB data containing CNA information in TSV format.

generate_patient_analysis(
  cncf_path = "path/to/impact_facets_annotated.cncf.txt",
  biomart_gr_path = "path/to/useful_annotations/biomart_gr.rds",
  patient_ids = c("P-0070753", "P-0001876", "P-0000004", "P-0000964"),
  outDir = "output_directory/",
  oncokb_cnas_path = "path/to/data_CNA.oncokb.txt"
)
Output
Comparison Plots : Generates PNG images for patient comparisons.
Differential Segments Data : Saves TSV files containing differential segment data.
Annotated Genes : Produces TSV files with gene annotations overlapping differential segments.
Heatmap : Creates visual representation of CN differences across samples.
Average TCN Difference Barplot : Generates barplot summarizing gained/lost regions with OncoKB annotations.
